### Week 6 Objectives:

* Master AWS Security fundamentals: Shared Responsibility Model, Identity Center, and Key Management.
* Develop skills in designing and visualizing Cloud Architecture using professional standards (Draw.io).
* Deep dive into NLP Attention Models: Seq2seq, Neural Machine Translation (NMT), and Evaluation metrics.
* Collaborate with the team to draft and refine the High-Level Architecture for the final project.
