### Week 2 Achievements:

- Developed a clear understanding of key Amazon VPC elements:
  - CIDR notation and subnetting
  - Public vs. Private subnets
  - Route tables and Internet Gateways (IGW)

- Acquired knowledge of connectivity and load distribution options:
  - VPN and AWS Direct Connect for hybrid connectivity
  - Load balancer fundamentals for traffic distribution

- Implemented network security constructs:
  - Configured Security Groups (instance-level, stateful)
  - Configured Network ACLs (subnet-level, stateless)

- Utilized the VPC Resource Map to visualize network topology and data flow.

- Held the kickoff meeting with the project team to coordinate next steps.
