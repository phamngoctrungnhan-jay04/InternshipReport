### Week 4 Objectives:

* Master Hybrid Cloud workflows: Importing/Exporting Virtual Machines (VMs) and integrating On-premises storage.
* Deepen knowledge of AWS Storage (EFS, FSx, Storage Gateway) and Compute (Autoscaling, Lightsail).
* Build the mathematical foundation for Natural Language Processing (NLP): Vector Spaces, Probability, and Linear Algebra.
* Finalize the semester project concept and setup the documentation framework using Hugo.

### Week 4 Achievements: 


* Hybrid cloud procedures validated:
  * Exported VMs from VMware Workstation and uploaded images to AWS.
  * Created AMIs and launched instances from those images.
  * Demonstrated the ability to move instances between cloud and local environments.

* Advanced storage solutions configured:
  * Deployed and tested an AWS Storage Gateway.
  * Mounted cloud file shares on on-premises hosts.
  * Managed S3 ACLs to ensure appropriate access controls.

* Mathematical groundwork for NLP established:
  * Used Python/NumPy for linear algebra computations.
  * Implemented Euclidean distance and cosine similarity for text vectors.
  * Reviewed Bayes’ theorem and Vector Space Models.

* Documentation & project planning:
  * Chose and configured a Hugo theme for reporting.
  * Finalized the project idea and documentation outline with the team.
