During my internship at **[First Cloud Journey / AWS Study Group]** from **September 15, 2025** to **November 28, 2025**, I had the opportunity to bridge the gap between academic theory and professional application in the field of Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence.

I actively participated in the **"Development of an Intelligent AI Chatbot using AWS Bedrock and Serverless Architecture"** project. Through this intensive period, I significantly improved my skills in **Cloud Infrastructure (AWS VPC, EC2, Lambda), Natural Language Processing (BERT, Transformers), and Full-stack System Integration**.

In terms of work ethic, I consistently strived to master new technologies (such as GenAI and Serverless), complied with project timelines, and collaborated effectively with mentors and team members to optimize the system architecture.

To objectively reflect on my internship period, I evaluate myself based on the following criteria:

| No. | Criteria | Description | Good | Fair | Average |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Professional knowledge & skills** | Grasping AWS core services, NLP algorithms, and applying them to build a functional product. | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 2 | **Ability to learn** | Rapidly adapting to new tech stacks (AWS Bedrock, Hugging Face) within a short timeframe. | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 3 | **Proactiveness** | Proposing architectural changes (Migration to Serverless) to improve performance. | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 4 | **Sense of responsibility** | Committing to deadlines for the Proposal, Midterm Exam, and Final Deployment. | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 5 | **Discipline** | Adhering to strict schedules, reporting guidelines, and organizational rules. | ☐ | ✅ | ☐ |
| 6 | **Progressive mindset** | Receptive to feedback regarding Architecture Diagrams and UI/UX design. | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 7 | **Communication** | Articulating technical concepts clearly in weekly reports and team meetings. | ☐ | ✅ | ☐ |
| 8 | **Teamwork** | Coordinating with Front-end and Back-end members to resolve integration conflicts. | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 9 | **Professional conduct** | Maintaining a respectful and professional attitude towards mentors and peers. | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 10 | **Problem-solving skills** | Debugging integration errors and optimizing system latency during the testing phase. | ☐ | ✅ | ☐ |
| 11 | **Contribution to project/team** | Delivering a working AI module and finalizing the system deployment on AWS. | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 12 | **Overall** | General evaluation of the entire internship period. | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |

### Areas for Improvement

* **Enhance Operational Discipline:** I need to strengthen my adherence to strict organizational workflows and time management to avoid last-minute crunches during deployment phases.
* **Deepen Problem-Solving Strategy:** Move from "reactive debugging" to "proactive architectural design" to anticipate and prevent system errors before they occur.
