	"content": "Summary Report: “AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar” Event Objectives Deep dive into the 5 core pillars of AWS Security: IAM, Detection, Infrastructure Protection, Data Protection, and Incident Response. Understand modern security principles: Zero Trust, Least Privilege, and Defense in Depth. Learn to automate security checks and incident response using AWS native tools. Identify common cloud threats in the Vietnam market and how to mitigate them. Key Highlights Opening \u0026amp; Security Foundation [Image of AWS Shared Responsibility Model] Core Principles: Moving beyond perimeter security to Defense in Depth, Zero Trust architecture, and strictly enforcing Least Privilege. Shared Responsibility Model: Clarifying what AWS secures (of the cloud) vs. what the customer secures (in the cloud). Local Context: Discussing top security threats specifically targeting cloud environments in Vietnam. Pillar 1: Identity \u0026amp; Access Management (IAM) [Image of IAM Identity Center architecture] Modern IAM Architecture: Moving away from long-term credentials (IAM Users) to temporary credentials (IAM Roles). Governance: Using IAM Identity Center for SSO and centralized management. Control: Implementing SCPs (Service Control Policies) and permission boundaries for multi-account environments. Best Practices: Enforcing MFA, regular credential rotation, and using Access Analyzer to validate policies. Pillar 2: Detection \u0026amp; Continuous Monitoring Logging Strategy: \u0026ldquo;Log everything\u0026rdquo; approach using CloudTrail (org-level), VPC Flow Logs, and ALB/S3 logs. Threat Detection: Utilizing Amazon GuardDuty for intelligent threat detection. Centralization: Aggregating findings in AWS Security Hub. Detection-as-Code: Automating alerts using Amazon EventBridge to trigger immediate notifications. Pillar 3: Infrastructure Protection [Image of AWS Network Security architecture] Network Security: Implementing rigorous VPC segmentation and distinguishing strictly between private and public subnets. Firewalls: Understanding the layered defense using WAF (Web Application Firewall), AWS Shield (DDoS), and Network Firewall. Access Control: Differentiating between Stateful (Security Groups) and Stateless (NACLs) firewalls. Pillar 4: Data Protection Encryption Strategy: At-rest: Encrypting S3 buckets, EBS volumes, RDS, and DynamoDB. In-transit: TLS/SSL enforcement. Key Management: Managing keys via AWS KMS (Key Management Service), focusing on grants and rotation policies. Secrets Management: Removing hardcoded credentials from code by using Secrets Manager and Systems Manager Parameter Store. Pillar 5: Incident Response (IR) [Image of Automated Incident Response workflow] IR Lifecycle: Preparation -\u0026gt; Detection \u0026amp; Analysis -\u0026gt; Containment, Eradication \u0026amp; Recovery -\u0026gt; Post-Incident Activity. Automation: Using AWS Lambda and Step Functions to auto-remediate issues (e.g., isolating a compromised EC2 instance). Playbooks: Walkthrough of standard responses for scenarios like \u0026ldquo;Compromised IAM Key,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;S3 Public Exposure,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Malware Detection.\u0026rdquo; Key Takeaways Identity is the New Perimeter Identity management is the most critical line of defense. Long-term access keys are a major risk; utilizing IAM Roles and SSO is mandatory for a modern architecture. Visibility is Paramount You cannot protect what you cannot see. Enabling centralized logging (CloudTrail, Config) and threat detection (GuardDuty) is the first step in any security strategy. Automate Security Humans are slow; attacks are fast. Security responses (locking down a user, blocking an IP) should be automated via code (Lambda/EventBridge) wherever possible. Applying to Work Audit IAM Policies: Review current permissions to ensure \u0026ldquo;Least Privilege\u0026rdquo; and remove unused IAM Users. Enable GuardDuty: Activate GuardDuty in the main region to detect anomalies immediately. Encrypt Data: Ensure all new S3 buckets and EBS volumes have default encryption enabled via KMS. Develop IR Playbooks: Draft a basic Incident Response plan for \u0026ldquo;S3 Public Leak\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Compromised Credentials\u0026rdquo; scenarios. Event Experience The \u0026ldquo;AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar\u0026rdquo; workshop was an intensive and highly focused morning session. It provided a structured approach to security that is often overlooked in rushed development cycles.\nDeep Dive into \u0026ldquo;Defense in Depth\u0026rdquo; The session on Infrastructure Protection clarified how to layer security controls (WAF -\u0026gt; NACL -\u0026gt; SG) so that if one fails, others are still in place. Practical Focus on Automation Seeing the \u0026ldquo;Mini Demo\u0026rdquo; on validating IAM policies and simulating access was very helpful. It showed that security can be tested just like software code. The Incident Response segment changed my perspective: instead of waking up at 3 AM to fix a hack manually, we can write Lambda functions to contain threats automatically. Local Context Hearing about common pitfalls in Vietnamese enterprises helped me relate the theoretical concepts to the actual risks our business faces daily. Some event photos Add your event photos here\nOverall, this event reinforced that security is not just a \u0026ldquo;gatekeeper\u0026rdquo; but an enabler of speed when done correctly through automation and solid architecture.\n"

Build a secure, scalable and cost-efficient cloud backend from day one using AWS best practices. Core architecture (summary):\nFrontend: React app hosted on AWS Amplify (CI/CD + CloudFront). Backend: Spring Boot services in ECS (Fargate) — serverless containers. Database: Amazon RDS (private subnets, automated backups, KMS encryption). Storage: Amazon S3 for media (use presigned URLs for direct uploads). API + Async: API Gateway as HTTPS ingress; SNS → Lambda → SES for email; Lambda → Bedrock for AI/chat. Network \u0026amp; Security: VPC (public/private), Security Groups, VPC Endpoints, WAF and least-privilege IAM. Key benefits:\nSecurity-first: backend and DB remain private; edge services terminate TLS and enforce WAF/rate limits. Cost-aware: Fargate + Lambda (pay-per-use), lifecycle rules and autoscaling reduce costs. Modern \u0026amp; modular: frontend/backend separation, event-driven async flows for resilience and scale. Workshop goals:\nProvision network and secure services, deploy frontend + backend, connect RDS and S3, and integrate email and AI pipelines. Each module includes steps, recommended settings and cleanup instructions. "

	"description": "",
	"content": "Architecture Overview This document describes the recommended production-ready architecture for ReGenZet — an EV Garage Management System — and explains the technology choices used in the workshop.\nFrontend: A React single-page application deployed and hosted via AWS Amplify. Amplify provides automated CI/CD, asset hosting and integration with CloudFront for global caching and fast client delivery. Backend: Containerized Spring Boot services packaged as Docker images and deployed to Amazon ECS (Fargate). Fargate removes host management overhead and provides scalable, serverless compute for microservices. Database: Amazon RDS (MySQL/Postgres) hosted in private subnets. RDS provides automated backups, snapshots, Multi-AZ options and encryption at rest (KMS). API Management: Amazon API Gateway exposes a single HTTPS entry point for client traffic, handles request routing, TLS termination and request throttling. Media Storage: Amazon S3 holds vehicle inspection images, videos and other media. Use presigned URLs for secure direct-upload/download to offload traffic from the backend. Asynchronous / Serverless components: Email pipeline: Backend (Spring) publishes an event to SNS, which triggers a Lambda to send email via Amazon SES. AI/Chat pipeline: Frontend → API Gateway → Lambda → Amazon Bedrock (or other managed LLM) for inference and conversational workflows. Network \u0026amp; Security: Deploy resources inside a VPC with well-defined Public and Private subnets. Use Security Groups and NACLs to control traffic. Use VPC Endpoints (Gateway and Interface) for S3 and private service access, keeping traffic inside the AWS network. Why this architecture? Security-first\nThe backend and RDS instances reside in private subnets and never expose database ports to the public internet. API Gateway and load-balanced frontends terminate TLS at the edge, while internal services communicate over private networking. Cost-efficiency\nFargate and Lambda offer a pay-for-what-you-use model. When appropriate, consider Fargate Spot for non-critical workloads and configure autoscaling and lifecycle policies for S3 to reduce costs. Operational simplicity \u0026amp; modern patterns\nClear separation of concerns between frontend and backend, with API Gateway as a single ingress point. Event-driven components (SNS, Lambda) decouple email and AI processing from request-response paths, improving resilience and scalability. Developer productivity\nAWS Amplify simplifies frontend CI/CD and hosting. Container workflows with Docker + ECR and ECS Fargate enable reproducible deployments for backend services. Security and best-practice highlights\nLeast-privilege IAM roles for services and cross-account access where needed. KMS-managed encryption for RDS and S3 objects. WAF and rate-limiting on API Gateway to mitigate application-level attacks. This architecture balances enterprise-grade security with cost-effective serverless patterns and provides a pragmatic path for incremental adoption of advanced features (observability, multi-region DR, Bedrock-powered AI).\n"

	"content": "APEX-EV Electric Vehicle Service Platform 1. Executive Summary RenGen is a comprehensive management platform designed to digitize and optimize maintenance workflows at service centers. The system centrally manages the entire service lifecycle—from request intake and repair processing to customer care—helping to eliminate manual tasks and enhance efficiency. Leveraging the power of the AWS cloud, RenGen combines flexible container architecture on Amazon ECS Fargate with the intelligent processing capabilities of Generative AI through Amazon Bedrock. The solution integrates automated development processes (CI/CD) from GitLab, ensuring rapid deployment speeds, high security, and rigorous monitoring, delivering a superior experience for end-users.\n2. Problem Statement What’s the Problem? Current operational processes rely heavily on manual methods, leading to inefficiencies, fragmented data, and a lack of intelligent support tools for automated customer interaction.\nThe Solution The platform employs a modern architecture, starting at the Edge layer with Amazon Route 53 for user routing. The interface (Frontend) is hosted on AWS Amplify Hosting, ensuring fast and stable access. Amazon API Gateway acts as the central hub, intelligently routing requests.\nTo ensure security, critical components such as ECS Fargate and the Amazon RDS database are placed in a Private Subnet, completely isolated from the public internet. Image data is stored on Amazon S3 and accessed securely via S3 Endpoints. Additionally, the software development process is fully automated: source code from GitLab is packaged and pushed to Amazon ECR for deployment to ECS.\nBenefits and Return on Investment Adopting this architecture delivers a significant competitive advantage by integrating Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) via Amazon Bedrock, which helps automate customer care and data analysis. The system ensures high availability and data security thanks to the VPC network separation design (Public/Private subnets).\nThe CI/CD process integrated with GitLab and ECR helps minimize downtime when updating new features, while Amazon CloudWatch provides comprehensive monitoring to detect incidents instantly. The cost model is optimized thanks to the use of Fargate (Serverless container) and Lambda (Pay-per-use), ensuring businesses only pay for the actual resources used. This investment not only resolves current operational challenges but also creates a solid technological foundation for long-term growth, with the expected Return on Investment (ROI) period significantly shortened.\n3. Solution Architecture The RenGen management platform utilizes a modern architecture deployed on AWS (Region ap-southeast-2), initiated by user access via Amazon Route 53 at the Edge layer. The User Interface (Frontend) is hosted on AWS Amplify Hosting, which establishes a direct connection to Amazon API Gateway as the central entry point.\nFrom the API Gateway, the data flow is strategically divided into three distinct paths:\nAI Tasks: Requests are routed to AWS Lambda to interact with Amazon Bedrock for generative AI capabilities. Notification Tasks: Asynchronous requests trigger AWS Lambda to handle email communications via Amazon SES. Core Business Logic: Traffic is directed through an Application Load Balancer (ALB) located in the Public Subnet, then forwarded to Amazon ECS Fargate instances secured within a Private Subnet. Data \u0026amp; Security:\nRelational data is persistently stored in Amazon RDS within the Private Subnet. To optimize security and performance, the architecture utilizes VPC Endpoints to keep traffic strictly within the AWS internal network:\nStatic assets and images stored in Amazon S3 are accessed securely via S3 Endpoints. Container images are pulled directly from Amazon ECR via ECR Endpoints. By leveraging these endpoints, the system eliminates the need for a NAT Gateway, thereby reducing costs and minimizing public internet exposure.\nDevOps \u0026amp; Monitoring:\nGitLab is used for source code management and CI/CD, automatically pushing deployments to Amplify (Frontend) and container images to ECR (Backend). AWS Services Used Route 53: DNS service, responsible for routing the domain (Edge layer) to the application. AWS Amplify Hosting: Hosts the web interface (frontend) and can integrate with CDN/WAF. In the diagram, it receives traffic from Route 53. Amazon API Gateway: The main entry point (Gateway), receiving and routing all requests from the frontend/Amplify to processing services. AWS Lambda (Bedrock): Handles AI/Generative AI tasks (prediction/content generation) by communicating with Amazon Bedrock. AWS Lambda (SES): Handles asynchronous tasks, such as processing notifications to send emails via AWS SES. Amazon Bedrock: General AI service (Gen AI), providing foundation models to execute intelligent business operations. AWS SES: Email sending service, performs the sending of notifications, quotes, or processing results from Lambda. VPC: Virtual network environment containing and protecting AWS resources (like ALB, ECS Fargate, RDS). ALB (Application Load Balancer): Load balancer, distributing traffic from API Gateway to application containers running on ECS Fargate. Amazon ECS Fargate: Runs the backend application as containers without server management, handling core business logic. Amazon RDS: Provides a relational database, placed in a Private Subnet to store structured data. Amazon S3: Stores multimedia files like photos or other large data. ECR: Repository for application container images (Docker), used by ECS Fargate for deployment. AWS CloudWatch: Monitoring service, collecting logs and metrics from the entire system to track performance and detect issues. Component Design Request Handling: Amazon Route 53 routes user domain requests to AWS Amplify Hosting, where the frontend interface is hosted. From there, API requests are forwarded to Amazon API Gateway, which acts as the central entry point to receive and route all incoming traffic.\nBusiness Logic Processing:\nCore Logic: All primary business operations are handled by containerized applications running on Amazon ECS Fargate, deployed within a Private Subnet to ensure maximum security. AI \u0026amp; Asynchronous Tasks: Generative AI tasks are processed by AWS Lambda interacting with Amazon Bedrock. Auxiliary tasks, such as email notifications, are handled by separate AWS Lambda functions triggering Amazon SES. Network Infrastructure:\nPublic Subnet: Hosts the Application Load Balancer (ALB) to receive and distribute external traffic. Private Subnet: Dedicated to sensitive resources including ECS Fargate and Amazon RDS, ensuring they are isolated from direct public internet access. VPC Endpoints: The system explicitly utilizes S3 Endpoints and ECR Endpoints. This design allows ECS Fargate to pull container images and access file storage securely within the AWS internal network, without traversing the public internet. Data Storage:\nAmazon RDS: Stores sensitive, structured relational data. Amazon S3: Stores multimedia files and large datasets. Deployment and Monitoring: The deployment pipeline is managed via GitLab, which triggers updates to AWS Amplify (Frontend) and pushes Docker images to Amazon ECR (Backend). Amazon CloudWatch provides comprehensive monitoring of performance logs and metrics across all services, from ECS and Lambda to RDS.\n4. Technical Implementation Implementation Phases The development project for the RenGen Smart Electric Vehicle Maintenance Platform — including the integration of an AI virtual assistant and a service management system — undergoes 4 phases:\nResearch and Architectural Design: Research suitable technologies (React.js, Spring Boot, AWS Bedrock) and design a system architecture combining Containers (ECS) and Serverless (Lambda) on AWS (1 month prior to commencement). Cost Estimation and Feasibility Check: Use the AWS Pricing Calculator to estimate operating costs for core services such as ECS Fargate, RDS, and token costs for Amazon Bedrock, and propose the most feasible solution. Architecture Adjustment for Cost/Solution Optimization: Refine the architecture, select appropriate configurations for ECS Fargate and RDS, and optimize Lambda runtime (timeouts) to balance AI processing performance and cost. Development, Testing, and Deployment: Program the React.js application (Frontend) and Spring Boot (Backend), integrate the Bedrock Agent, deploy CI/CD pipelines via GitLab, package Docker images to ECR, and launch operations on ECS. Technical Requirements Technical Requirements User Interface (Frontend): Practical knowledge of React.js to build scheduling interfaces and chat with the AI virtual assistant. Use AWS Amplify to automate the deployment process (Hosting), connect with Amazon API Gateway to send secure processing requests, ensuring a smooth user experience on all devices. Core System (Backend \u0026amp; Infrastructure): In-depth knowledge of Java/Spring Boot to develop maintenance business logic. The application is packaged using Docker, with images stored on AWS ECR and running on Amazon ECS Fargate. Requires understanding of Amazon RDS for relational databases (storing vehicle profiles, maintenance history). Specifically, requires AWS Lambda (Python) programming skills to connect with Amazon Bedrock (AI/Chatbot processing) and AWS SES (sending asynchronous email notifications). Manage detailed user authentication and authorization (customers/technicians) via Amazon Cognito. 5.

Optimize security: Configure AWS WAF (block SQL Injection, XSS) and review IAM access rights. Operational monitoring: Setup Dashboard on Amazon CloudWatch to track logs and metrics of ECS Fargate and Lambda. Official deployment. 6. Budget Estimation Infrastructure Costs\nAmazon ECS Fargate: ~11.00 USD/month. Application Load Balancer (ALB): ~16.43 USD/month. Amazon Bedrock (AI): ~5.00 USD/month (Calculated by Token count). AWS Lambda: 0.00 USD/month (Free Tier). Amazon RDS \u0026amp; ElastiCache: 0.00 USD/month (Free Tier). S3 Standard: ~0.15 USD/month. AWS Amplify \u0026amp; API Gateway: ~0.50 USD/month. Amazon CloudWatch: 0.00 USD/month (Free Tier). Amazon SES: 0.00 USD/month (Free Tier). Total: ~32.63/month.\n7. Risk Assessment Risk Matrix System downtime: High impact, low probability. Security breach/Data loss: Very high impact, low probability. Operational cost overrun: Medium impact, medium probability. Mitigation Strategies System: Deploy infrastructure across Multi-AZ for RDS and ECS Fargate. Use Application Load Balancer for automatic load distribution and recovery. Security: Use AWS WAF to filter malicious requests. Strict authorization with Amazon Cognito and apply least privilege principle. Backend placed in a separate network (Private Subnet). Cost: Use AWS Budgets to set alerts when costs exceed thresholds. Regularly monitor and optimize resources (right-sizing) to avoid waste. Incorrect AI response: Medium impact, medium probability. Contingency Plans System: Deploy ECS Fargate and RDS infrastructure across Multi-AZ to ensure high availability. Use Application Load Balancer for automatic load coordination and Auto-scaling to expand Tasks when traffic spikes. AI Quality: Limit Bedrock Agent response scope via strict Prompt Engineering (System Prompts) and only allow information retrieval from moderated Knowledge Bases. Enable Automated Backups for RDS and Point-in-time Recovery to restore data to any point in time. 8. Expected Outcomes Technical Improvements: Technical Improvements: Successfully build a modern Hybrid Architecture combining Microservices (ECS Fargate) and Serverless (Lambda, Bedrock), ensuring flexible scalability without managing physical servers.\nLong-term Value Enhance customer experience: AI virtual assistant operating 24/7 helps reduce waiting time, increasing appointment conversion rates and car owner satisfaction.\nData assets: Maintenance history and interaction behavior data are centrally stored on RDS/S3, creating a premise for deploying AI Predictive Maintenance models for electric vehicle batteries and motors in the future.\n"

The objective of this workshop is to design and deploy a secure, cost-optimized, and highly automated cloud infrastructure on AWS to host ApexEV\u0026rsquo;s frontend, backend, storage, and serverless AI/ML functions.\nKey architectural principles:\nSecurity-first: least-privilege IAM, encrypted data at rest and in transit, network isolation and controlled service endpoints. Cost optimization: use managed services with pay-as-you-go models, right-sizing, and automated lifecycle policies for storage and compute. Automation \u0026amp; Observability: Infrastructure-as-Code, CI/CD pipelines, centralized logging, and automated monitoring/alarms. Core services used in this workshop:\nAWS ECS (Fargate) — run backend microservices without managing servers. AWS Amplify — host the frontend, provide CI/CD for web clients and manage hosting. Amazon RDS — managed relational database for transactional data. Amazon S3 — object storage for media, backups, and static assets. AWS Lambda — serverless functions for AI/ML processing pipelines, notifications and background tasks. This workshop contains hands-on modules covering the end-to-end stack and best practices for each layer.\nContent Workshop Overview Project Architecture VPC Of Project Database And Storage Compute And Container Create Load Balancing Create Amplify And API Gateway Intruct Deploy Code Frontend and Backend "

FCJ members are always willing to help whenever I encounter difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is tidy and comfortable, helping me focus better. However, I think it would be nice to have more social gatherings or team bonding activities to strengthen relationships.\n2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin\nThe mentor provides very detailed guidance, explains clearly when I don’t understand, and always encourages me to ask questions. The admin team supports administrative tasks, provides necessary documents, and creates favorable conditions for me to work effectively. I especially appreciate that the mentor allows me to try and solve problems myself instead of just giving the answer.\n3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major\nThe tasks I was assigned align well with the knowledge I learned at university, while also introducing me to new areas I had never encountered before. This allowed me to both strengthen my foundational knowledge and gain practical skills.\n4. Learning \u0026amp; Skill Development Opportunities\nDuring the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork skills, and professional communication in a corporate environment. The mentor also shared valuable real-world experiences that helped me better plan my career path.\n5. Company Culture \u0026amp; Team Spirit\nThe company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but still keeps things enjoyable. When there are urgent projects, everyone works together and supports one another regardless of their position. This made me feel like a real part of the team, even as an intern.\n6. Internship Policies / Benefits\nThe company provides an internship allowance and offers flexible working hours when needed. In addition, having the opportunity to join internal training sessions is a big plus.\nAdditional Questions What did you find most satisfying during your internship?
